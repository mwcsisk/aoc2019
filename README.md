Puzzle prompt was to calculate the fuel necessary to power a number of modules based on their mass. The input from AoC was a text file containing the masses of a number of modules as integers, each on their own line of the text file. I decided to handle the potential exceptions if this program were run with a file that was not formatted correctly, eg a CSV.
