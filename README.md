# Hello!
You've stumbled upon the repository I'm using to track my programs for Advent of Code 2019. I'm a novice Python programmer who got bored of doing straight webdev and wanted to work on some more interesting problem-solving while also doing my best to learn and use best practices. Each problem will have its associated scripts on its own branch (future tense since I'm writing this before I've written any code), and the master branch will just contain this readme. If you want to take a look at my code, please feel free! I would appreciate any and all comments on my work. However, not that I expect this, but it's worth saying up front: **please don't use this code for any commercial purposes without my express permission**. In general I would recommend not grabbing random code off of GitHub from users you don't know and using it in an enterprise setting regardless of whether or not you have permission to do so, but you do you. Just not with this repository.
