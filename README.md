# 3-1

I've taken a step back from instituting the best of best practices in order to get this work done, so you'll likely see less commits and more spaghetti; that being said, I did still separate out a function into a module instead of putting it in my main script. This turned out to be helpful for part two of day 3, and is something I'll probably keep doing since that seems to be the style of problem-solving AoC is encouraging.

Debugging was a bit difficult for me - on the left direction in my function defintion of map_wire, I accidentally typed 'ypos' instead of 'xpos', and I had trouble nailing down the problem. Lots of prints were created (I still haven't figured out how to debug in VSCode when an argument is needed for the script).
