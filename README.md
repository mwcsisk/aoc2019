# 2-1

Prompt introduced the concept of Intcode, a low-level language that processed a string of integers based on a given set of rules. I put the processing of these rules in a function I called "intcomp" (since it computed the Intcode), then built a main function that accepted either a file or a string of integers at the command line. This was my first time using the "ArgumentParser" object. The prompt had us modify the input file slightly, but I decided to do that outside of the code.
