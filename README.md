# 3-2

Prompt was to find the intersection closest to the beginning of each wire (combined). This was relatively easy since the hard lifting was almost entirely done when I completed 3-1. Since I used lists and not sets for that task, this just took replacing the last few lines of script.py to use some index functions.
