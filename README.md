# 1-2

Prompt was similar to 1-1 but asked us to calculate the fuel needs for the fuel we added, and then the fuel needs for that fuel, etc. I put fuel calculation into a recursive function outside of main so I could test it in the shell. I hardcoded the base condition based on the amount of mass that would result in zero or negative fuel requirements instead of having the program calculate the fuel needs and compare it after.
